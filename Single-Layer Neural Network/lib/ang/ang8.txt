UPS Freight is the less than truckload shipping (LTL) division of UPS. UPS acquired on August 8, 2005, Overnite Transportation Company (and its subsidiary Motor Cargo) from the Union Pacific Corporation (parent company of the Union Pacific Railroad) for $1.25 billion. On April 28, 2006, Overnite Transportation officially became UPS Ground Freight, Inc.
The logos on the doors of the Overnite tractors were covered with signs showing the operator as UPS Freight. UPS Freight soon changed the color scheme of the tractors from blue and grey to UPS brown on the bottom, with a gold line near the center of the tractor and gray for the upper color. All new vehicles purchased by UPS Freight LTL come painted in these colors as the older Overnite equipment is replaced, while the new tractors for the truckload division (Former Overnite Transportation â€“ Special Services Division) are solid white with the UPS shield on the roof fairing.
UPS is recognized as a most loved brand for three years (2016-2019) straight by consumers.
UPS Freight is based in Richmond, Virginia.
