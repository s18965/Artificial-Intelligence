Controversy
In May 2012, it was claimed by Silver Meikar, a Reform Party member and a former member of the Riigikogu, that the Reform Party has been receiving donations from dubious sources for years. He further argued that Michal was informed about these donations. Both Michal and Prime Minister Andrus Ansip denied these allegations. However, upon these accusations, the delegates from the Council of Europe's GRECO anti-corruption watchdog visited the country in June 2012. On 31 July 2012, the Estonian State Prosecutor's Office announced that Michal and Kalev Lillo, another Reform Party member, were suspects of this event and that they both had been interrogated. Michal was investigated on accusations of money laundering and illegal party financing. On 10 September 2012, the first day of parliamentary session, the Social Democratic Party's faction started a petition process for the resignation of Michal through a vote of no confidence. However, petition failed on 19 September 2012 when the party gave up the process. Michal announced that if he would be found guilty, he would resign from his post. Estonian State Prosecutor's Office closed the case on 15 October 2012.
On 15 October 2012, the prosecutor general closed the investigation. Back then, prosecutor Heli Sepp stated that the investigation was concluded with no evidence supporting the accusations.
